kOS Dev Test 
======
Is derived from kOS and intended for personal use. If it ever goes beyond that it would be intended for mod developer use.
Its use case is to run repeatable test cases, and make accurate fast observations for Devs in hard to observe edge cases. 
It is not intended nor ever should any feature added here be directly back ported diretcly into kOS.
If something happened to become perceived generally useful reimplenting it properly in kOS is the only recommended option. I intend to cut corners here. 
Rewriting, not code review is what would remove them.
